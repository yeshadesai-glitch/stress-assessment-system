# stress-assessment-system
A Python-based system for evaluating stress levels using weighted behavioural and psychological indicators.
Good. Here is your clean, honest, future-proof README.

## Overview
The Stress Assessment System is a Python-based program designed to evaluate stress levels using weighted behavioural and psychological indicators.
The system converts qualitative responses (such as sleep quality, emotional state, energy levels, and concentration) into a structured scoring model to classify overall stress severity.
This project simulates an early stress awareness tool using computational logic.

## How It Works
* Users respond to questions related to stress-related factors.
* Each factor is assigned a weight based on its relative impact.
* A total score is calculated.
* The score is compared against defined thresholds.
* Feedback is generated based on the calculated stress severity level.

The system currently uses rule-based logic and conditional evaluation.

## Features
* Multi-factor stress evaluation
* Weighted scoring mechanism
* Severity classification (e.g., Low, Moderate, High)
* Condition-based feedback generation
* Structured threshold logic

## Why This Project?

This project was created to explore how computational logic can support early stress awareness among teenagers. By structuring behavioural and psychological indicators into a measurable scoring system, the system models how early identification of elevated stress levels might be approached in a simplified, programmatic format.
It is designed as an educational and awareness tool rather than a clinical solution.

## Future Improvements
* Improve scoring calibration through data analysis
* Store and analyse historical results
* Add graphical data visualisation
* Develop a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Integrate basic machine learning techniques
* Expand feedback to adapt based on specific stress factors
  
## Technologies Used
* Python
